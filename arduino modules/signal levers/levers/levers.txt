Levers

This module will read the value of upto 8 switches or levers and transmit the change to the opnehab server where rules will then fire to move points or signals.

The module is designed to be used with a nodemcu but other wifi arduino modules will work as well with small changes.

In the arduino code look for //**changeme**//  this will indicate values that either need to be changed or can be left as is.

SSID change to the name of your wifi network.
PASSWORD change to your wifi password.
IPADDRESS change to the ip address of the MQTT server which is running on your raspberry pi or other server running openhab.

lever_name is the name of the module.   If you plan on running more than one lever module this needs to be changed otherwise it can stay the same.

Within openhab server you will need to enable the following bindings.

MQTT action.
MQTT Binding.
Map transformation.

These are best enabled using the paper UI.  screenshots are in the directory.
