signal

This module will move 2 servos which can be connected to 2 semaphore arms.  The starting and end position of each servo is controlled from openhab rules along with an LED brightness.
The servos will move down slowly and up quickly with a bounce to replicate real life semaphore signals.

The openhab rule will pass a string to the module which is then decoded.

"A:BBB:CCC:DDD"
A is either 1 or 0 for on or off.
BBB is a 3 digit number between 000 and 180 this is the starting position of the servo.
CCC is a 3 digit number between 000 and 180 this is the end position of the servo.
DDD is a 3 digit number between 000 and 256 this sets the LED brightness 000 is off and 256 is full brightness.   

Change these values allows the signals to be tweaked once in place without having to reflash the arduino.

Two leds can be used one for each signal arm and the brightness of each can be changed for both the one and off position.

The module is designed to be used with a nodemcu but other wifi arduino modules will work as well with small changes.

1. Arduino code.

Open singal.ino in the arduino IDE and look for //**changeme**//  this will indicate values that either need to be changed or can be left as is.

SSID change to the name of your wifi network.
PASSWORD change to your wifi password.
IPADDRESS change to the ip address of the MQTT server which is running on your raspberry pi or other server running openhab.

Having multiple entryâ€™s enables a module to be tested on one system then deployed on another.  The IP address of the MQTT server needs to be be fixed in the DHCP section of your wifi router.

Topic_1 and Topic_2 are the MQTT topic set in the rules file in openhab.  They need to be unique to every servo.



2. Arduino hardware.

I recommend using nodemcus as the base arduino, they are cheap wifi boards that will fit easily on a breadboard.  signal_schematic.png shows the wiring diagram.  There is a fritz file signal.fzz.

Any servo will do I suggest using the 9g SG90 servos. These servos need 5v to work.

I recommend using jst connectors soldered to a breadboard to connect the switches then a 15 way header to connect the arduino. See components.txt for an example list of components and costs.



3. Openhab bindings.

Within openhab server you will need to enable the following bindings.

MQTT action.
MQTT Binding.
Map transformation.

These are best enabled using the paper UI.  Screenshots are in the directory.

The onoff.map file in the transform directory needs to be copied into the openhab config transform directory.



4. Openhab rules.

The rules file determines what values are passed to the signal module.  In the example below "signal_3" needs to be changed to what ever you called the signal in topic_1 of the arduino code.  The string afterwards is in the following format.

"A:BBB:CCC:DDD"
A is either 1 or 0 for on or off.
BBB is a 3 digit number between 000 and 180 this is the starting position of the servo.
CCC is a 3 digit number between 000 and 180 this is the end position of the servo.
DDD is a 3 digit number between 000 and 256 this sets the LED brightness 000 is off and 256 is full brightness.

4.1 Simple example.

rule "lever-3"
when
	Item Lever3 changed
then
    if(Lever3.state == ON) 
    	publish("broker", "signal_3", "1:010:055:256")
    else 
    	publish("broker", "signal_3","0:010:055:012")
end

This is included in the rules directory.  In this example when lever one is switched on then signal_1 is told to move.


4.2 two signal example.

rule "lever-9"
when
	Item Lever9 changed
then
    if(Lever1.state == ON) 
    	{
		publish("broker", "signal_1", "1:010:055:256")
		publish("broker", "signal_1", "1:010:055:256")
		}
    else 
    	{
		publish("broker", "signal_2","0:010:055:256")
		publish("broker", "signal_2","0:010:055:256")
		}
end


This will move 2 signals such as a home and distant when a lever nine is switched on.  Using these it can be easily expanded to route setting usng times.
For example set a distant signal then wait 30 seconds, then set a  home signal then wait 10 seconds before setting two points.
