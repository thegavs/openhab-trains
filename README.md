# openhab-trains
Openhab-trains.  Combining the power of home automation systems and cheap arduinos to provide open source modules for running model trains.

The core of the system is Openhab2 running on a Raspberry Pi. 

https://www.openhab.org/

Openhab is open source and free to use.

For ease of install I suggest using Openhabian.

The Aim for this project is for people to be able to develop and add other modules to expand the system.

The modules are arduinos

I suggest using the nodemcu exp8266 or esp32 modules as they are inexpensive and powerful.
